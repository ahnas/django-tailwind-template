- Virtual Environment (venv)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

```

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment
- On Windows:
  ```sh
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS/Linux:
  ```sh
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Required Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Additional Notes
- Ensure you have `tailwindcss` properly installed in `node_modules` if you face any issues.
- If encountering issues with Tailwind, try reinstalling dependencies using:
  ```sh
  rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
  npm install
  ```
- Make sure to commit your `requirements.txt` file to track dependencies.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
